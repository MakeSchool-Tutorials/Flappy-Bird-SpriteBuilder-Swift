In this tutorial we will build Hoppy Bunny -- a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird. Building the game itself is a simple introduction to game development! We will use Apple's new Swift programming language together with SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D.

<!-- If you aren't familiar with SpriteBuilder you should read our [SpriteBuilder beginner tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spritebuilder-and-swift/installing-spritebuilder) first since this tutorial assumes that you are familiar with basic SpriteBuilder tasks. Make sure you have both SpriteBuilder and Xcode installed! -->

# What you will learn

This tutorial will teach you how to implement a Flappy Bird clone for iOS using Apple's new Swift programming language together with SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D. You'll start with a blank project.

If you complete this tutorial you will learn how to:

*   implement an endless scroller
*   implement procedural level generation
*   use physics with Cocos2D
*   use Swift with Cocos2D

#The finished product

The final game will look like this:
